# Got Trash
Got Trash is an iOS trash can map locator app. I was inspired to make this app when I lived in South Korea. If there's one thing South Korea is notorious for, it's for their lack of public trash cans, which is how I got the inspiration for this app. Got Trash is a proprietary app I plan to release onto the Apple Store later this year. I have been religiously working on this app for the past month and have enjoyed every moment of it. 

Currently, the app features a fully functional GPS location system, users are also able to center back onto their current location after panning around. Got Trash also features a functional Sign Up and Login screen (including Sign Out functionality) where user authentication is handled by Firebase. There is also the ability to add a trash can at the user's current location. The trash can locations are stored and handled by a Firebase database and queried by GeoFire. Users also have the ability to search for trash cans around a certain address and/or establishment. A slide-out side menu is also featured to allow users to navigate through the app.

I am extremely excited with how far I've been able to take Got Trash, and I can't wait to see what other ideas and functionalities I implement into the app. Through this app, I was really able to challenge and practice my skills on Delegates & Protocols and API calls through Firebase/GeoFire (user authentication, database storage, location queries). I was able to implement two UITableViews, one for the side menu and the other for the UISearchBar (which slides up!), and I really take pride in the fact that I got it to function properly.

# Wake Up Happy

Wake Up Happy is an iOS video streaming notification reminder app. This app was an idea I had when I first started learning Swift iOS programming, a project I started but couldn't finish at the time due to my lack of knowledge in Swift. Ideally, I would love to publish this to the App Store and be used by those who could use a little bit more happiness during their mornings. Wake Up Happy opens up to a tap screen that plays a video, includes an "About" page and has notification functionality that the user can set to create reminders to watch a video at a certain time every morning.

I am extremely proud with how the app turned out and that I was able to bring it to completion. The next step now is to expand the database of videos. With Wake Up Happy, I continued my journey using the MVC architecture while learning and using the UserNotifications framework and implementing Notifications & Observers. I also utilized UIPickerView that allow users to set their own reminder time. I used Firebase as the backend and for video storage. And like with all my apps, Wake Up Happy was created without storyboards.

# Lightsaber

Lightsaber is an iOS motion gesture app, a throwback to the early iPhone days and the single color lightsaber apps. I was inspired by such apps and decided to try my hand at coding my own virtual lightsaber. The lightsaber opens with a tap of a button, and lightsaber sound effects are played with each swing of your iPhone. The app currently features two lightsabers, Luke Skywalker's and Darth Vader's.

I am really happy with this project, however, it is not at its final version as I plan to add a variety of lightsabers. Lightsaber was my second app using the MVC pattern, as I wanted to continue practicing and challenging my skills with the MVC architecture pattern. Lightsaber really cemented the MVC pattern into my coding habits, to which I feel very proud of. Additionally, Lightsaber utilizes Auto Layout (no storyboard) for UI design, UIView animations, and UIEvent motion gestures.

# Shotgun

Shotgun is an iOS motion gesture app. This project was an idea I got when I was thinking about existing apps that were simple enough for me to recreate. I somehow stumbled upon the thought of the old shotgun gesture apps, and so I went to work. This was my first time working with the MVC architecture pattern, as simple as this app is, I really take pride of the fact that I was able to correctly utilize the MVC pattern into this project. Prior to this, I had been studying/reading/practicing the MVC and MVVM patterns. In Shotgun, you first tap on reload to load the shotgun--then somewhat-violently--cock your iPhone upwards and back to simulate gun recoil, which then plays a shotgun sound effect.

I was extremely happy with how the app turned out, especially with Shotgun being one of my first apps that could be on the App Store. I'm proud of the fact that I was able to correctly utilize the MVC architecture pattern while utilizing variable closures and UIEvent motion gestures.
